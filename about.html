                    My path into web development wasn't straightforward, but that's what makes it meaningful. 
                   Over the past year, I have gained practical experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (with TypeScript), applying these skills to create efficient and user-centered digital interfaces that align functionality with design precision.
Beyond frontend technologies, I am expanding my expertise toward Machine Learning and AI-driven web applications, driven by a desire to integrate intelligence and automation into modern web solutions.

                <p data-testid="skills-text">
                    I possess a solid foundation in frontend web development, with core proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (with TypeScript). My expertise extends to creating responsive layouts, implementing accessible user interfaces, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility to deliver seamless digital experiences. I am skilled in applying modern development practices, maintaining clean code architecture, and leveraging design principles to enhance usability and performance.

                    Accessibility isn't just a feature—it's a fundamental right. I'm committed to building web 
                    experiences that are inclusive by default. I believe in writing code that is maintainable, 
                    well-documented, and respectful of users' time and bandwidth. Continuous learning keeps me 
                    engaged and humble; there's always something new to discover, and I approach each project 
                    as an opportunity to improve my craft.
